#Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning
##Introduction
Spam emails are unwanted and unsolicited emails that are sent to a large number of recipients. These emails are often sent for the purpose of advertising or phishing. Spam emails can be a nuisance for users as they take up space in their email inboxes and can sometimes contain malicious links or attachments.

Using machine learning, it is possible to build a model that can classify emails as spam or not spam (also known as "ham"). In this project, we will build and train a machine learning model to detect spam emails.

Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.6 or higher
A computer with a processor and enough memory to support the required packages
You will also need to install the following Python packages:

•	numpy
•	pandas
•	scikit-learn
•	keras (if you want to use a deep learning model)
Data
The data used for this project is the Spam Email Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains a collection of emails, each with a label indicating whether it is spam (1) or ham (0). The dataset also includes a set of features for each email, such as the frequency of certain words and characters.

Model Training
To train the model, we will use a machine learning algorithm to learn the patterns in the data that distinguish spam emails from ham emails. We will split the data into a training set and a test set, and use the training set to fit the model. Then, we will evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for spam email detection, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests. 

Model Evaluation
After training the model, we will evaluate its performance on the test set. We will use a few different metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

Conclusion
Using machine learning, we have built a model that can detect spam emails with high accuracy. This model can be used to filter out spam emails and improve the user experience for individuals and organizations.
